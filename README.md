# Louis Hyman Website

This repository now hosts a refreshed static site for historian Louis Hyman, suitable for GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `index.html` and `styles.css`: modern, single-page site highlighting books, essays, talks, podcasts, and contact details.
- `old_files/`: full archive of the migrated Wix/HTTrack capture for reference. Nothing was deleted.
- `CNAME`: custom domain for `www.louishyman.com`.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Form submissions use a `mailto:` action and will open your default email client addressed to `lhyman@gmail.com`.
