      <h2>Temp: How American work became temporary</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">A history of how deliberate decisions by consultants and executives reshaped job security, long before the apps of the gig economy.</p>
      <p>Temp traces how the postwar pillars of stability—unions, corporate stewardship, and regulation—were dismantled in favor of short-term returns. Through stories of consultants, temps, office workers, and laborers, it explains how the American Dream was unmade and why insecurity runs deeper than Uber or downsizing.</p>
